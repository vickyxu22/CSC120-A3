While I didn't consult with a classmate while working on this assignment, I sought help from my friends who major in computer science. Though there are some differences between Python and Java, the logic behind these two languages is identical. I still need to get used to some Java syntax. I found Java more concise than Python, which means it uses less memory. Moreover, Java requires us to insert the variable type, which requires more precision. I found it hard to start programming because I need to have the structure in my mind. Thus, I found the importance of pseudocodes. Lastly, I need to look up new things on the internet to learn.
